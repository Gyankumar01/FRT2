problem statement :- 
Traditionally the method in which customers specify their desired menu to the waiter who takes the order on a paper. Personally, he then takes the order to the kitchen department and then he supply the food item to the customer. So, it was a time-consuming process. It leads to wastage of paper and also it requires reprinting of all menu cards. Also, in many cases for small change to be making in menu card it is not convenient to print all menu cards again and again. Simply saying that the menu card once printed canâ€™t be changed. After some days, the menu card lost its worthy look and attractiveness. For booking a table for your friends or a family you need to go to the restaurant and you need to book if the hotel is far from the restaurant then it will be a time taking task .


The main objective of this project is to make the ordering system and reservation system of restaurant digital and effective ."MEAL MONKEY" handle the system as booking and ordering by digitally which become save manpower and time of staff of hotel. Generating KOT by application is easy to save paper, staff and time. The hotel are services and facilized in a traditional way, from waiters to kitchen also on account.
